# CyanoLakes data repository for remote sensing of inland waters

This is a repository for bio-optical data for remote sensing of inland waters. All data appears in peer-review scientific publications, which are cited below. In terms of the license, the data are free to use but MUST be accompanied with the relevant citation acknowledging the source of the data.  

Data is restricted to: 
- Apparent Optical Properties
- Inherent Optical Properties
- Biogeophysical Data
